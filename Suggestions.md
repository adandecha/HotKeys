For the first time users, I recommend you press **CapsLock+F1+Z+M**.
<br/>
It'll turn on notifications and make HJKL the Arrow keys instead of WASD.
<br/>
So, you can observe the HotKeys working magic for you in real-time!
<br/>
After some getting used to, you won't even be needing those notifications!
<br/>
<br/>
Personally,
<br/>
**I find HJKL as the Arrow keys better than WASD!**
<br/>
(It's a habbit you pick up from using Vim; don't worry if you don't know Vim!)
<br/>
Because using Left Alt/Shit/Ctrl with HJKL feels more comfortable!
<br/>
And having I & O as BackSpace & Delete makes life a bit easier.
<br/>
<br/>
So, for a couple of days, **try HJKL, it's fun!**
<br/>
(You can press CapsLock+M and always switch back to WASD as Arrow keys.)
<br/>
<br/>
**GLHF!**
