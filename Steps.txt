Download and install AutoHotkey if not already present, to be able to compile .ahk files.

Steps to run HotKeys as Admin, every time the Windows starts.

    Move the HotKeys.ahk file to '%ProgramFiles%/HotKeys/ directory'.

    Open 'Task Scheduler' and in that do 'Create Task'.

    In 'General' tab,
        Give the task a name, say, 'HotKeys'.
        Check 'Run only when user is logged on'.
        Check 'Run with highest privileges'.
        Configure for 'Windows 10'.

    In 'Triggers' tab,
        Click 'New...'
        In 'Begin the task' select 'At startup'

    In 'Actions' tab,
        Click 'New...'
        Action start a program.
        Browse and select the HotKeys.ahk file.

    In 'Conditions' tab,
        Uncheck 'Start the task only if computer is idle for'
        Uncheck 'Start the task only if computer is on AC power'
        Uncheck 'Wake the computer to run this task'
        Uncheck 'Start only if the following network is available'

    In 'Settings' tab,
        Check 'Allow task to be run on demand'
        Check 'Run task asap after a scheduled start is missed'
        Uncheck 'If the task fails restart every'
        Uncheck 'Stop task if runs longer than'
        Check 'If the running task doesn't end when requested force it to stop'
        Uncheck 'If the task is not scheduled to run again, delete it after'
        If already running then choose to stop the existing instance.

    Goto '%AppData%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup'
    Create a new shortcut, and that too to 'schtasks.exe /run /tn HotKeys'

    Done!
